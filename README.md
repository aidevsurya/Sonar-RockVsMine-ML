## üìñ About the Project

The core of this project is a machine learning pipeline that processes sonar return data and trains a model to identify potential underwater threats. By leveraging Logistic Regression, the model learns the distinct patterns in sonar signals that separate metallic, mine-like objects from natural rock formations, providing a reliable predictive tool for underwater navigation and security.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

The project is designed to be run in two simple steps from your terminal.

1.  **Prepare the Dataset**
    First, run the `dataset.py` script. This will process the raw data and prepare it for training.
    ```sh
    python dataset.py
    ```

2.  **Train the Model**
    Next, run the `train_model.py` script. This will train the Logistic Regression model on the prepared data, evaluate its performance, and display the accuracy.
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```
