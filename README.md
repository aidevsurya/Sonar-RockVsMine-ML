This project focuses on building a machine learning model to differentiate between underwater sonar signals reflected from a rock and a mine. This is a classic binary classification problem with significant applications in naval warfare and underwater exploration.

## üìñ About the Project

The project utilizes a dataset of sonar returns to train a logistic regression model. The model learns to identify the subtle patterns in the sonar signals that distinguish a metallic, mine-like object from a natural rock formation. This predictive capability can be crucial for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and submarines to navigate safely and identify potential threats.

## üéØ Key Features

-   **Data Preprocessing and Analysis:** The sonar dataset is thoroughly cleaned, analyzed, and prepared for model training.
-   **Logistic Regression Model:** A robust and interpretable logistic regression model is implemented for the classification task.
-   **Model Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and its performance is evaluated on unseen data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
-   **Predictive System:** A simple predictive system is built to classify new sonar data as either a rock or a mine.

## üíª Technologies Used

-   **Python:** The core programming language used for the project.
-   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
-   **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulations.
-   **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
-   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.
